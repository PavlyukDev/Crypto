#  Crypto

The sample app is based on MVVM and RxSwift to display a list of cryptocurrencies. The app updates the list every 5 seconds. I used Cocoapods as a dependency manager. 

## Install

To launch the app use

```
bundle install
bundle exec pod install
```  

## Points to improve
- Add more tests cases
- Add dependecy injection
